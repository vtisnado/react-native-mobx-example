# react-native-mobx-example
This is a very simple example in how to use Mobx to manage state in **React Native**.
Is important to install the Babel plugins so you can use the @ decorator.

## How to run
1. Clone this repo `git clone https://github.com/vtisnado/react-native-mobx-example`
2. run `npm install` to install all the packages or manually install Mobx with `npm i -S mobx mobx-react`
3. run `npm install babel-plugin-transform-class-properties --save`
4. run `npm install babel-plugin-transform-decorators-legacy --save`

Finally run `react-native run-android` to see the project in the emulator. Additional details can be found in the source code.
